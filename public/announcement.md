# ActionSchema is building an automated Search Engine for the AI Internet

The internet is full of useful products. Most of them are directly oriented to people via a GUI. Some of them however, have an API. APIs were already great. By using powerful APIs, developers can stand upon the shoulders of giants and build amazing new things.

But there's a lot of friction: APIs are hard to find, hard to get access to, and hard to use. ActionSchema is solving this problem by creating a search engine that brings forward the best tools from the most reliable, secure, and scalable APIs in an easy way. With ActionSchema, we are not building a product, but we are bridging the gap between having an intention, and using a tool to get solve a problem.

> "ActionSchema is like myelin in the brain - we're helping the individual cells connect to each other much faster. Where humans must now establish these connections manually through a GUI, ActionSchema will 100x reduce friction for this by making the process of finding the right tools highly automated." - Wijnand Karsens, Founder of ActionSchema

There is much more to be done, but you can try ActionSchema today through [our website](https://actionschema.com) and sign up for our private early access program for our API and early access to next-level features.
