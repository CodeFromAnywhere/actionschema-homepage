## **10X Reduced Time To Market for Tech Startups**

</center>

# Quality Software is Hard

- No-code solutions have hard limits in its capability, security, scalability, vendor lock-in, and lack of ownership.
- Highly Custom Tech Products have Long Time to market and are expensive to build.

# ActionSchema makes it as easy as ABC

In order to get the best of both worlds, we created an **AI SWE that can create, deploy, and maintain scalable systems, built using code that developers love**. This will reduce the cost of useful systems 100X.
