# 10X Reduced Time To Market for Tech Startups

# Problem/Solution

- No-code solutions have hard limits in its capability, security, scalability, vendor lock-in, and lack of ownership.
- Highly Custom Tech Products have Long Time to market and are expensive to build.

In order to get the best of both worlds, we created an **AI SWE that can create, deploy, and maintain scalable systems, built using code that developers love**. This will reduce the cost of useful systems 100X.

# What does it take to build a tech product?

> Code From Anywhere is a Startup Studio as a Service
>
> The goal: “As accessible as Zapier, as scalable as the product you’d get from a software development startup studio

AI with tools (GPTs, Claude Artifacts, Rabbit R1)

- B2C
- Low scale & capability
- Low cost & learning curve

AI no-code solutions (Zapier, Make.com)

- B2B
- Medium scale & medium capability
- Medium cost & learning curve

AI Agent Framework/Tool (LangChain, Crew.ai, Jina.ai, Firecrawl.dev)

- B2D
- Prod-time SDK's/API's
- On-site Expert required

Classical Software Developer + AI coding (devin, github co-pilot)

- B2D
- Increased developer productivity
- Dev-time tools
- High scale & capability
- On-site Expert required

The "AI SWE" category (AI Software Engineer) is a mixture between this...

- B2D
- Reduced time to market
- Reduced development capacity required
- Build highly scalable products (both agents and apps)
- Both dev-time tools and prod-time SDK/API gateway -->
