I have an idea for a website to make it easy for regular people to make websites for their peers and people nearby. Target audience: the Netherlands.

we use a new no code technology (AI + code generation) to allow everyone to make a website by describing the idea in Dutch.

The name of the website should be 'peerby'.

please make a POC it in HTML, CSS, JS and TailwindCSS that will wow visitors.
