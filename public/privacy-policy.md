## How we collect and use (process) your personal information

ActionSchema collects personal information about its website visitors and customers. With a few exceptions, this information is generally limited to:

- name
- job title
- employer name
- work address
- work email
- work phone number

We use this information to provide prospects and customers with services.

We do not sell personal information to anyone and only share it with third parties who are facilitating the delivery of our services.

From time to time, ActionSchema receives personal information about individuals from third parties. Typically, information collected from third parties will include further details on your employer or industry. We may also collect your personal data from a third-party website (e.g. LinkedIn)

## Use of the ActionSchema Website

As is true of most other websites, ActionSchema’s website collects certain information automatically and stores it in log files. The information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the internet, browser type, operating system and other usage information about the use of ActionSchema’s website, including a history of the pages you view. We use this information to help us design our site to better suit our users’ needs. We may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website, analyze trends, track visitor movements, and gather broad demographic information that assists us in identifying visitor preferences.

ActionSchema has a legitimate interest in understanding how members, customers and potential customers use its website. This assists ActionSchema with providing more relevant products and services, with communicating value to our sponsors and corporate members, and with providing appropriate staffing to meet member and customer needs.

## Cookies and tracking technologies

ActionSchema makes available a comprehensive Cookie Notice that describes the cookies and tracking technologies used on ActionSchema website and provides information on how users can accept or reject them.

## Sharing information with third parties

The personal information ActionSchema collects from you is stored in one or more databases hosted by third parties located in the EU and/or the United States. These third parties do not use or have access to your personal information for any purpose other than cloud storage and retrieval.

We do not otherwise reveal your personal data to non-ActionSchema persons or businesses for their independent use unless:

(1) you request or authorize it;

(2) it’s in connection with ActionSchema-hosted and ActionSchema co-sponsored conferences as described above;

(3) the information is provided to comply with the law (for example, compelled by law enforcement to comply with a search warrant, subpoena, or court order), enforce an agreement we have with you, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our employees or others;

(4) the information is provided to our agents, vendors or service providers who perform functions on our behalf;

(5) to address emergencies or acts of God; or

(6) to address disputes, claims, or to persons demonstrating legal authority to act on your behalf.

We may also gather aggregated data about our services and website visitors and disclose the results of such aggregated (but not personally identifiable) information to our partners, service providers, advertisers, and/or other third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.

The ActionSchema website connects with third-party services such as LinkedIn, Twitter and others. If you choose to share information from the ActionSchema website through these services, you should review the privacy policy of that service. If you are a member of a third-party service, the aforementioned connections may allow that service to connect your visit to our site to your personal data.

## Transferring personal data to the U.S.

ActionSchema has its headquarters in the Netherlands. Information we collect about you will be processed in the Netherlands. By using ActionSchema’s services, you acknowledge that your personal information will be processed in the Netherlands. Depending on the circumstance, ActionSchema also collects and transfers to the U.S. personal data with consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfil a compelling legitimate interest of ActionSchema in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. ActionSchema endeavours to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with ActionSchema and the practices described in this Privacy Statement. ActionSchema also enters into data processing agreements and model clauses with its vendors whenever feasible and appropriate. Since it was founded, ActionSchema has received zero government requests for information.

## Data Subject rights

The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other countries’ privacy laws provide certain rights for data subjects. Data Subject rights under GDPR include the following:

- Right to be informed
- Right of access
- Right to rectification
- Right to erasure
- Right to restrict processing
- Right of data portability
- Right to object
- Rights related to automated decision making including profiling

This Privacy Notice is intended to provide you with information about what personal data ActionSchema collects about you and how it is used.

If you wish to confirm that ActionSchema is processing your personal data, or to have access to the personal data ActionSchema may have about you, please contact us.

You may also request information about: the purpose of the processing; the categories of personal data concerned; who else outside ActionSchema might have received the data from ActionSchema; what the source of the information was (if you didn’t provide it directly to ActionSchema); and how long it will be stored. You have a right to correct (rectify) the record of your personal data maintained by ActionSchema if it is inaccurate. You may request that ActionSchema erase that data or cease processing it, subject to certain exceptions. You may also request that ActionSchema cease using your data for direct marketing purposes. In many countries, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how ActionSchema processes your personal data. When technically feasible, ActionSchema will—at your request—provide your personal data to you.

Reasonable access to your personal data will be provided at no cost. If access cannot be provided within a reasonable time frame, ActionSchema will provide you with a date when the information will be provided. If for some reason access is denied, ActionSchema will provide an explanation as to why access has been denied.

For questions or complaints concerning the processing of your personal data, you can email us at wijnand@ActionSchema.com

Alternatively, if you are located in the European Union, you can also have recourse to the European Data Protection Supervisor or with your nation’s data protection authority.

## Data storage and retention

Your personal data is stored by the ActionSchema on its servers, and on the servers of the cloud-based database management services the ActionSchema engages, located in the United States. The ActionSchema retains service data for the duration of the customer’s business relationship with the ActionSchema and for a period of time thereafter, to analyze the data for ActionSchema’s own operations, and for historical and archiving purposes associated with ActionSchema’s services. ActionSchema retains prospect data until such time as it no longer has business value and is purged from ActionSchema systems. All personal data that ActionSchema controls may be deleted upon verified request from Data Subjects or their authorized agents. For more information on where and how long your personal data is stored, and for more information on your rights of erasure and portability, please contact us at: wijnand@ActionSchema.com.
